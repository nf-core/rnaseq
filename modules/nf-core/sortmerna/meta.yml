      description: The core algorithm is based on approximate seeds and allows for sensitive analysis of NGS reads. The main application of SortMeRNA is filtering rRNA from metatranscriptomic data. SortMeRNA takes as input files of reads (fasta, fastq, fasta.gz, fastq.gz) and one or multiple rRNA database file(s), and sorts apart aligned and rejected reads into two files. Additional applications include clustering and taxonomy assignation available through QIIME v1.9.1. SortMeRNA works with Illumina, Ion Torrent and PacBio data, and can produce SAM and BLAST-like alignments.
