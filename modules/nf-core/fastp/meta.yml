        Groovy Map containing sample information. Use 'single_end: true' to specify single ended or interleaved FASTQs. Use 'single_end: false' for paired-end reads.

        List of input FastQ files of size 1 and 2 for single-end and paired-end data,
        respectively. If you wish to run interleaved paired-end data,  supply as single-end data
        but with `--interleaved_in` in your `modules.conf`'s `ext.args` for the module.
