Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

## [[3.9](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.9)] - 2022-09-30

### Enhancements & fixes

- [[#746](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/746)] - Add `tin.py` output to MultiQC report
- [[#841](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/841)] - Turn `--deseq2_vst` on by default
- [[#853](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/853)] - Pipeline fails at email step: Failed to invoke `workflow.onComplete` event handler
- [[#857](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/857)] - Missing parameter required by StringTie if using STAR as aligner
- [[#862](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/862)] - Filter samples that have no reads after trimming
- [[#864](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/864)] - Pre-process transcripts fasta when using `--gencode`
- Expose additional arguments to UMI-tools as pipeline params: `--umitools_bc_pattern2` is required if the UMI is located on read 2. `--umitools_umi_separator` will often be needed in conjunction with `--skip_umi_extract` as most other tools such as Illumina's `BCL Convert` use a colon instead of an underscore to separate the UMIs. The `--umitools_grouping_method` allows to fine-tune handling of similar but non-identical UMIs.
- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.5.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.5.1)

## [[3.8.1](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.8.1)] - 2022-05-27

- [[#834](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/834)] - `nf-core download` fails with version 3.8 of the pipeline

## [[3.8](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.8)] - 2022-05-25

### :warning: Major enhancements

Fixed quite a well hidden bug in the UMI processing mode of the pipeline when using `--with_umi --aligner star_salmon` as reported by [Lars Roed Ingerslev](https://github.com/lars-work-sund). Paired-end BAM files were not appropriately name sorted after `umi_tools dedup` which ultimately resulted in incorrect reading and quantification with Salmon. If you have used previous versions of the pipeline to analyse paired-end UMI data it will need to be reprocessed using this version of the pipeline. See [#828](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/828) for more context.

### Enhancements & fixes

- [[#824](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/824)] - Add explicit docs for usage of featureCounts in the pipeline
- [[#825](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/825)] - Pipeline fails due to trimming related removal of all reads from a sample
- [[#827](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/827)] - Control generation of --output-stats when running umi-tools dedup
- [[#828](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/828)] - Filter BAM output of UMI-tools dedup before passing to Salmon quant
- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.4.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.4.1)

### Parameters

| Old parameter | New parameter            |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
|               | `--min_trimmed_reads`    |
|               | `--umitools_dedup_stats` |

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

| Dependency  | Old version | New version |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `samtools`  | 1.14        | 1.15.1      |

## [[3.0](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.0)] - 2020-12-15

### :warning: Major enhancements

- You will need to install Nextflow `>=20.11.0-edge` to run the pipeline. If you are using Singularity, then features introduced in that release now enable the pipeline to directly download Singularity images hosted by Biocontainers as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images (see [#496](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/496)).
- The previous default of aligning BAM files using STAR and quantifying using featureCounts (`--aligner star`) has been removed. The new default is to align with STAR and quantify using Salmon (`--aligner star_salmon`).
  - This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)).
- For similar reasons, **quantification will not be performed** if using `--aligner hisat2` due to the lack of an appropriate option to calculate accurate expression estimates from HISAT2 derived genomic alignments.
  - This pipeline option is still available for those who have a preference for the alignment, QC and other types of downstream analysis compatible with the output of HISAT2. No gene-level quantification results will be generated.
  - In a future release we hope to add back quantitation for HISAT2 using different tools.

### Enhancements & fixes

- Updated pipeline template to nf-core/tools `1.12.1`
- Bumped Nextflow version `20.07.1` -> `20.11.0-edge`
- Added UCSC `bedClip` module to restrict bedGraph file coordinates to chromosome boundaries
- Check if Bioconda and conda-forge channels are set-up correctly when running with `-profile conda`

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

- Check that gtf features are on chromosomes that exist in the genome fasta file [#274](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/pull/274)
- Maintain all gff features upon gtf conversion (keeps `gene_biotype` or `gene_type` to make `featureCounts` happy)
- Add SortMeRNA as an optional step to allow rRNA removal [#280](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/280)
- Minimal adjustment of memory and CPU constraints for clusters with locked memory / CPU relation

## [[1.1](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/1.1)] - 2018-10-05

### Pipeline updates

- Wrote docs and made minor tweaks to the `--skip_qc` and associated options
- Removed the depreciated `uppmax-modules` config profile
- Updated the `hebbe` config profile to use the new `withName` syntax too
- Use new `workflow.manifest` variables in the pipeline script
- Updated minimum nextflow version to `0.32.0`

### Bug Fixes

- [#77](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/77): Added back `executor = 'local'` for the `workflow_summary_mqc`
- [#95](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/95): Check if task.memory is false instead of null
- [#97](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/97): Resolved edge-case where numeric sample IDs are parsed as numbers causing some samples to be incorrectly overwritten.

## [[1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/1.0)] - 2018-08-20

This release marks the point where the pipeline was moved from [SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq)
over to the new [nf-core](http://nf-co.re/) community, at [nf-core/rnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq).

In addition to porting to the new nf-core community, the pipeline has had a number of major changes in this version.
There have been 157 commits by 16 different contributors covering 70 different files in the pipeline: 7,357 additions and 8,236 deletions!

In summary, the main changes are:

- Rebranding and renaming throughout the pipeline to nf-core
- Updating many parts of the pipeline config and style to meet nf-core standards
- Support for GFF files in addition to GTF files
  - Just use `--gff` instead of `--gtf` when specifying a file path
- New command line options to skip various quality control steps
- More safety checks when launching a pipeline
  - Several new sanity checks - for example, that the specified reference genome exists
- Improved performance with memory usage (especially STAR and Picard)
- New BigWig file outputs for plotting coverage across the genome
- Refactored gene body coverage calculation, now much faster and using much less memory
- Bugfixes in the MultiQC process to avoid edge cases where it wouldn't run
- MultiQC report now automatically attached to the email sent when the pipeline completes
- New testing method, with data on GitHub
  - Now run pipeline with `-profile test` instead of using bash scripts
- Rewritten continuous integration tests with Travis CI
- New explicit support for Singularity containers
- Improved MultiQC support for DupRadar and featureCounts
  - Now works for all users instead of just NGI Stockholm
- New configuration for use on AWS batch
- Updated config syntax to support latest versions of Nextflow
- Built-in support for a number of new local HPC systems
  - CCGA, GIS, UCT HEX, updates to UPPMAX, CFC, BINAC, Hebbe, c3se
- Slightly improved documentation (more updates to come)
- Updated software packages

...and many more minor tweaks.

Thanks to everyone who has worked on this release!
