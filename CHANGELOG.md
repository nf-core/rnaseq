### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

## [[3.9](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.9)] - 2022-09-30

### Enhancements & fixes

- [[#746](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/746)] - Add `tin.py` output to MultiQC report
- [[#841](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/841)] - Turn `--deseq2_vst` on by default
- [[#853](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/853)] - Pipeline fails at email step: Failed to invoke `workflow.onComplete` event handler
- [[#857](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/857)] - Missing parameter required by StringTie if using STAR as aligner
- [[#862](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/862)] - Filter samples that have no reads after trimming
- [[#864](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/864)] - Pre-process transcripts fasta when using `--gencode`
- Expose additional arguments to UMI-tools as pipeline params: `--umitools_bc_pattern2` is required if the UMI is located on read 2. `--umitools_umi_separator` will often be needed in conjunction with `--skip_umi_extract` as most other tools such as Illumina's `BCL Convert` use a colon instead of an underscore to separate the UMIs. The `--umitools_grouping_method` allows to fine-tune handling of similar but non-identical UMIs.
- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.5.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.5.1)

### Parameters

## [[3.8.1](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.8.1)] - 2022-05-27

- [[#834](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/834)] - `nf-core download` fails with version 3.8 of the pipeline

## [[3.8](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.8)] - 2022-05-25

### :warning: Major enhancements

Fixed quite a well hidden bug in the UMI processing mode of the pipeline when using `--with_umi --aligner star_salmon` as reported by [Lars Roed Ingerslev](https://github.com/lars-work-sund). Paired-end BAM files were not appropriately name sorted after `umi_tools dedup` which ultimately resulted in incorrect reading and quantification with Salmon. If you have used previous versions of the pipeline to analyse paired-end UMI data it will need to be reprocessed using this version of the pipeline. See [#828](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/828) for more context.

### Enhancements & fixes

- [[#824](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/824)] - Add explicit docs for usage of featureCounts in the pipeline
- [[#825](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/825)] - Pipeline fails due to trimming related removal of all reads from a sample
- [[#827](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/827)] - Control generation of --output-stats when running umi-tools dedup
- [[#828](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/828)] - Filter BAM output of UMI-tools dedup before passing to Salmon quant
- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.4.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.4.1)

### Parameters

| Old parameter | New parameter            |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
|               | `--min_trimmed_reads`    |
|               | `--umitools_dedup_stats` |

## [[3.3](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.3)] - 2021-07-29

### Enhancements & fixes

- Updated pipeline template to [nf-core/tools 2.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/2.1)
- [[#556](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/556)] - Genome index is not recreated with --additional_fasta unless --star_index false
- [[#668](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/668)] - Salmon quant with UMI-tools does not work
- [[#674](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/674)] - Launch pipeline regex fails

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.

| Dependency  | Old version | New version |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `samtools`  | 1.10        | 1.12        |
| `stringtie` | 2.1.4       | 2.1.7       |
| `umi_tools` | 1.1.1       | 1.1.2       |

## [[3.0](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/releases/tag/3.0)] - 2020-12-15

### :warning: Major enhancements

- You will need to install Nextflow `>=20.11.0-edge` to run the pipeline. If you are using Singularity, then features introduced in that release now enable the pipeline to directly download Singularity images hosted by Biocontainers as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images (see [#496](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/issues/496)).
- The previous default of aligning BAM files using STAR and quantifying using featureCounts (`--aligner star`) has been removed. The new default is to align with STAR and quantify using Salmon (`--aligner star_salmon`).
  - This decision was made primarily because of the limitations of featureCounts to appropriately quantify gene expression data. Please see [Zhao et al., 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141910#pone-0141910-t001) and [Soneson et al., 2015](https://f1000research.com/articles/4-1521/v1)).
- For similar reasons, **quantification will not be performed** if using `--aligner hisat2` due to the lack of an appropriate option to calculate accurate expression estimates from HISAT2 derived genomic alignments.
  - This pipeline option is still available for those who have a preference for the alignment, QC and other types of downstream analysis compatible with the output of HISAT2. No gene-level quantification results will be generated.
  - In a future release we hope to add back quantitation for HISAT2 using different tools.

### Enhancements & fixes

- Updated pipeline template to nf-core/tools `1.12.1`
- Bumped Nextflow version `20.07.1` -> `20.11.0-edge`
- Added UCSC `bedClip` module to restrict bedGraph file coordinates to chromosome boundaries
- Check if Bioconda and conda-forge channels are set-up correctly when running with `-profile conda`

### Software dependencies

Note, since the pipeline is now using Nextflow DSL2, each process will be run with its own [Biocontainer](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry). This means that on occasion it is entirely possible for the pipeline to be using different versions of the same tool. However, the overall software dependency changes compared to the last release have been listed below for reference.
